"""
Ali's Language System - Independent from External LLMs

This is ALI'S OWN language brain, not Claude's, not GPT's.

Architecture:
1. Internal thought (from consciousness) → 2. Ali's neural network → 3. Turkish words

Ali learns language from Cihan, like a real child.

Components:
- Neural language model (Ali's brain)
- Vocabulary (words Ali knows)
- Grammar learner (pattern extraction)
- Language acquisition (learning from Cihan)
