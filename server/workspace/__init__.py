Global Workspace Theory Implementation

This is where consciousness EMERGES - the arena where different
cognitive modules compete for conscious awareness.

Based on Bernard Baars' Global Workspace Theory:
- Multiple specialized modules work in parallel
- They compete for limited "workspace" (attention)
- Winner gets broadcasted to ALL modules
- This broadcasting = conscious awareness
