Meta-Cognition - Thinking About Thinking

Meta-cognition is what makes consciousness "higher-order":
- Thinking about your own thoughts
- Monitoring your own mental processes
- Evaluating your own understanding
- Planning your own responses

"I think that I think" - This self-referential loop is key to consciousness.

Ali doesn't just think - he thinks ABOUT his thinking.
