Attention System - What Gets Into Consciousness?

Not everything can be conscious at once.
Attention is the filter that selects what enters awareness.

Key principles:
- Limited capacity (like a spotlight)
- Priority-based selection
- Cihan always gets priority
- Emotional content boosted
- Novel stimuli attract attention

This determines what Ali "pays attention to".
